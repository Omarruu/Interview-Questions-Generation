# Interview-Questions-Generation
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to generate tailored interview questions by combining LangChain, OpenAI's language models, and a custom knowledge base. Itâ€™s designed to assist job seekers, educators, and HR professionals by generating accurate and context-aware interview questions based on relevant documents or input topics.

Key Features:

  - RAG architecture: integrates document retrieval with LLM-based question generation
  - Built with LangChain for orchestration and chaining logic
  - Uses OpenAI GPT models for natural question generation
  - Allows customization based on job role, domain, or experience level
  - Ideal for mock interviews, recruitment automation, and learning platforms
